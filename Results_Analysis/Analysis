Results & Analysis of Stock Market Prediction Using LSTM:

1. Data Processing & Preparation
The dataset was collected from Yahoo Finance (yfinance) and Alpaca API.
Data preprocessing included scaling stock prices using MinMaxScaler, which helps improve model accuracy.
The dataset was split into training and testing sets, ensuring the model learns from past trends and generalizes well to new data.

2. LSTM Model Training & Performance
The model architecture was built using Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) layers from TensorFlow/Keras.
The model was trained using historical stock prices, optimizing for minimized loss.
Loss function (e.g., MSE or RMSE) was used to evaluate the model’s performance, showing how well predictions matched actual stock prices.

3. Stock Price Prediction Results
The model successfully captured stock price trends but may have shown some variations due to market volatility.
Prediction accuracy: The predicted values closely followed the actual stock prices, demonstrating the model’s effectiveness in short-term forecasting.
The visualization using matplotlib showed a smooth trend line, with some deviations that indicate market fluctuations.

4. Insights & Limitations
✅ Strengths:
LSTM effectively recognizes patterns in time-series data and learns long-term dependencies.
Predictions are fairly accurate when stock prices follow historical trends.

⚠️ Limitations:
Stock market is highly volatile, and real-world factors (news, economic events) impact prices, which LSTM alone cannot predict.
Model performance depends on data quality—inaccurate or incomplete data can lead to less reliable predictions.
